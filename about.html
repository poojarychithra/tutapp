                <h3>Here's a time line of Terry Pratchett's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>1948</strong> - Born in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England</li>
                  <li><strong>1959</strong> - Earning a place in High Wycombe Technical High School (now John Hampden Grammar School) where he was a key member of the debating society and wrote stories for the school magazine.</li>
                  <li><strong>1963–1964</strong> - He collected Brooke Bond tea cards about space, owned a telescope and wanted to be an astronomer but lacked the necessary mathematical skills.He developed an interest in reading science and began attending science fiction conventions</li>
                  <li><strong>1968</strong> - Pratchett had his writing breakthrough in 1968 when he interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director of a small publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. During the meeting, Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, The Carpet People.Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by Pratchett.The book received strong, if few, reviews and was followed by the science fiction novels The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981).</li>
                  <li><strong>1983</strong> - The first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in hardback by Colin Smythe Ltd in 1983. The paperback edition was published by Corgi, an imprint of Transworld, in 1985. Pratchett's popularity increased when the BBC's Woman's Hour broadcast The Colour of Magic as a serial in six parts, and later Equal Rites. Subsequently, the hardback rights were taken by the publishing house Victor Gollancz Ltd, which remained Pratchett's publisher until 1997, and Colin Smythe became Pratchett's agent. Pratchett was the first fantasy author published by Gollancz.</li>
                  <li><strong>1993</strong> - In 1993, the family moved to Broad Chalke, a village west of Salisbury, Wiltshire.He listed his recreations as "writing, walking, computers, life". He described himself as a humanist and was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society. He was the patron of the Friends of High Wycombe Library.</li>
                  <li><strong>2007</strong> In August 2007, Pratchett was misdiagnosed as having had a minor stroke in 2004 or 2005, which doctors believed had damaged the right side of his brain. While his motor skills were affected, the observed damage had not impaired his ability to write.On 11 December 2007, Pratchett posted online that he had been newly diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, which had been responsible for the "stroke". He had a rare form of the disease, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), in which areas at the back of the brain begin to shrink and shrivel.</li>
                  <li><strong>2008</strong> - On 31 December 2008, it was announced that Pratchett was to be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours.He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, with the help of his friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that “At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10 miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80 kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – ‘thunderbolt iron’ has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me.”</li>
                  
                  <li><strong>2009</strong> - In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point.He later said he felt "it should be possible for someone stricken with a serious and ultimately fatal illness to choose to die peacefully with medical help, rather than suffer." Pratchett was selected to give the 2010 BBC Richard Dimbleby Lecture, entitled Shaking Hands With Death, broadcast on 1 February 2010. Pratchett introduced his lecture on the topic of assisted death, but the main text was read by his friend Tony Robinson because Pratchett's condition made it difficult for him to read.In June 2011 Pratchett presented a one-off BBC television documentary, Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die, about assisted suicide. It won the Best Documentary award at the Scottish BAFTAs in November 2011.</li>
                  <li><strong>2015</strong> - Pratchett died at his home on the morning of 12 March 2015 from his Alzheimer's, according to his publisher.The Telegraph reported an unidentified source as saying that despite his previous discussion of assisted suicide, his death had been natural. After Pratchett's death, his assistant, Rob Wilkins, wrote from the official Terry Pratchett Twitter account:AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night.The End.</li>
